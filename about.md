Webpage of the [Book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-54369-2) "Parallel C++: Efficient and Scalable High-Performance Parallel Programming Using HPX".

The examples are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ModernCPPBook/Examples) and the C++ Explorer is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevenrbrandt/CxxExplorer).

As carefully we proofread the book, there will be always some bugs or issues which we will collect in the [Addendum](https://hpxbook.stellar-group.org/addendum/2024/08/15/addendum.html). 

This blog will showcase new features of the C++ 23 and C++ 26 standard mentioned in the book.
