In this blog post, we will provide more details on how to install HPX on your ssytem.

## Fedora Linux

On Fedora we mantain the [HPX package](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/hpx/) and the package can be installed as follows:


{% highlight bash %}
# Shared memory version
sudo dnf install hpx-devel
# Distributed memory version
sudo dnf install hpx-mpich-devel 
{% endhighlight %}

## Mac OS

On Mac OS, we recommend to install the depencies with `brew` and compile HPX using CMake as follows:

{% highlight bash %}
brew install hwloc cmake boost
git clone https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx.git
cd hpx
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DHPX_WITH_FETCH_ASIO=ON ..
make -j 8
{% endhighlight %}

## Spack

On supercomputers and clusters, the HPX package mananger [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) can be used to install HPX. 

{% highlight bash %}
# Install spack (Update v0.22 with the latest Spack release)
git clone --depth=100 --branch=releases/v0.22 https://github.com/spack/spack.git ~/spack
# Activate Spack
. ~/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
# Find compilers
spack compiler find
# Install hpx 
spack install hpx
# Install distributed hpx
spack external find openmpi
spack install hpx networking=mpi ^openmpi 
{% endhighlight %}
